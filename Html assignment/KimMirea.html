    <p>Full Name: Blessing Temiloluwa Fasoyin</p>
    <p>Hello,</p>
    <P>My name is Blessing, I'm 18 years of age, I'm a college student studing in  Osun State University and majoring in Software Engineering. I don't have a favorite food because, i am not a fan of food -I only eat out of nessecity- but I enjoying snacks, like cakes, biscuit, choclate and other enjoyable yummies but not really a fan of small chops. My favorite drink is coca-cola and sometimes Ribena. I enjoy doing alot of things, but my hobbies are:
        <ul>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Reading Novels</li>
            <li>Taking care of babies & toddlers</li>
            <li>And most of all occuping myself with <b>anything that is Korean (From their movies to their food, their culture, their language, everthing)</b></li>
        </ul>
        Because  of this likeness to Korean, my autograph is <b>김미래 Fashies</b>, and it is also the reason my favorite website is Nkiri.com. Nkiri.com is a website where you can accsess most of the released kdramas (Korean Dramas) and the ones still in production. to access thi website <a href="https://nkiri.com">Click Here</a>. My aspiration for my nearest future when -I'm done done with school- is to work as a Software Engineer, in a software developing company and a web developer as a side job. 
    </P>
